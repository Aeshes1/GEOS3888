Relationships between tectonic environments and deposits of gold in Western U.S.A displayed through Random Forest and SVM

Welcome,
This repository includes the work that was used to create the paper titled above. The python notebook files have been altered from the original files obtained through (Butterworth et.al. 2019). 
Through utilising codes such as coregloop, we learned to coregister data files and create pickle files which combined data of deposits with tectonic settings across the globe.
The pickle files were then used in another python file to run machine learning processes. This is where we trained and tested the data to create accurate charts, figures and tables
that help us derive information. The python packages we utilised for our coding are (Gplates, pickle, scikit-learn, scipy, matplotlib, numpy, jupyter, cartopy, pandas, notebook and more).
